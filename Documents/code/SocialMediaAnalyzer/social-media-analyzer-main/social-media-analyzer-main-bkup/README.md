# Social Media Analyzer
This implementation follows the principles of OOP:

**Encapsulation:** 
The SocialMediaPost class encapsulates its properties, and access to those properties is provided through getters. The SocialMediaManager class also encapsulates its internal data (the posts list) and provides methods to interact with it.

**Abstraction:**
The SocialMediaPost class abstracts the concept of a social media post by encapsulating its properties and behavior, hiding the internal details from the outside world.

**Inheritance:** 
In this specific implementation, there is no explicit inheritance. However, the principles of encapsulation and abstraction are the foundation of OOP, and classes can be easily extended to demonstrate inheritance if needed in a more complex scenario.

By using OOP concepts, the program becomes more organized, maintainable, and extensible. It separates concerns and allows us to focus on specific functionalities within individual classes.
